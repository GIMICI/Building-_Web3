# web3-react-native
[Web3](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.6/) Native Modules for [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/).

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Using [`npm`]():

```bash
npm install --save web3-react-native
```

Using [`yarn`]():

```bash
yarn add web3-react-native
```

For versions less than [React Native 0.60](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2019/07/03/version-60), be sure to execute `react-native link` to make the native library dependencies visible to your compiled application.

### iOS
Remember to execute `pod install` within your iOS directory to synchronize the `Podfile`. Finally, make a new build of your app via `react-native run-ios`.

### Android
Perform a rebuild of your compiled application by calling `react-native run-android`.

For usage details, please see the [**documentation**](./docs).
